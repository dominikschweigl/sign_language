# Summary

All in all the auto encoder was not worth for this task. The normal CNN showed already really good results and the autoencoder did not make it easier.

## Advantages

- modular architecture. This shortens then training time, because when modifying a part of the NN, the other part does not need training.

## Disadvantages

- Training is seperat. Because of this, the output of the encoder is not always good for classification.
